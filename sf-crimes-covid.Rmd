## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(lubridate)

sessionInfo()
```

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size=8, base_family="Source Sans Pro") +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(family="Source Sans Pro Bold", margin=margin(t = -0.1, b = 0.1, unit='cm'), size=10),
                  axis.title.x = element_text(),
                  axis.title.y = element_text(),
                  axis.text.y = element_text(family="Fira Code", size=4),
                  axis.text.x = element_text(family="Fira Code", size=4),
                  plot.subtitle = element_text(family="Source Sans Pro Semibold", color="#969696", size=8),
                  plot.caption = element_text(color="#969696"),
                  legend.title = element_text(),
                  legend.key.width = unit(0.25, unit='cm')))
```


# Load Data

```{r}
file_path <- "/Users/maxwoolf/Downloads/Police_Department_Incident_Reports__2018_to_Present.csv"
start_date <- "2020-03-01"
end_date <- "2020-03-28"   # last full day of data

df <- read_csv(file_path) %>%
  filter(`Incident Date` >= start_date, `Incident Date` <= end_date)

df %>% head()
```

Filter to only categories w/ atleast 10 at one day to clean up the cart.


```{r}
df_agg <- df %>%
  group_by(date = `Incident Date`, category = `Incident Category`) %>%
  tally() %>%
  arrange(category, date)

df_agg %>% head()
```

Filter to only categories w/ atleast 10 at one day to clean up the cart.

```{r}
categories <- df_agg %>%
  filter(n >= 10) %>%
  pull(category) %>%
  unique() %>%
  filter()

categories
```

Remove `Offences Against The Family And Children` because it's too verbose, and removing it gets the chart to a nice 4x4 square.


```{r}
sip_date <- "2020-03-16"

plot <-
  ggplot(
    df_agg %>% filter(
      category %in% categories,
      category != "Offences Against The Family And Children"
    ),
    aes(x = date, y = n, color = category)
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    aes(xintercept = as.Date(sip_date)),
    color = "black",
    linetype = "dashed",
    size = 0.25
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = '1 week',
    date_labels = "%b\n%d",
    minor_breaks = NULL
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma_format(accuracy = 1), minor_breaks = NULL) +
  scale_color_hue(l = 50, guide = F) +
  facet_wrap( ~ category, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Reported Daily Crime Incidents in San Francisco Before/After COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place",
       subtitle = "For March 2020. Vertical dotted line indicates SIP announcement on March 16th. Data via datasf.org.",
       x = "Date",
       y = "# Reported Incidents",
       caption = "Max Woolf â€” @minimaxir")

ggsave('sf-crimes-covid.png', plot, width = 6, height = 4)
```
